** About **
Friend Book - A Social Networking Platform, is a way to connect with people around the world. As the last couple of years were consumed with the widespread of the COVID-19 pandemic, social activities saw a drastic drop which led to a decrease in social networking as well. Therefore, our project aims to connect people across the globe.

The program will allow the user to find and add new people as their friends from all across the globe, see mutual friends and friend suggestions based on similar data entered by the user when signing up. It will also encompass many other options like unfriend if you donâ€™t want someone to be your friend, see your friends profile, edit your own profile and other cool stuff.
